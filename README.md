## Description

![Bulletin Fetcher Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegoglezsu/bulletin-fetcher/main/docs/assets/logo.jpg)

**bulletin-fetcher** is a Python library for programmatic access to legal acts published in official bulletins, with current support for the **Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU / DOUE)** through the EUR-Lex / Cellar SPARQL endpoint.

The library provides a high-level Python API that allows developers, researchers and legal-domain experts to search EU legal acts without writing SPARQL queries directly.

## Why bulletin-fetcher?

EU legal acts can be queried through public semantic web infrastructure, but using the underlying SPARQL endpoint requires knowledge of RDF vocabularies, query structure and EUR-Lex metadata conventions and ontologies.

`bulletin-fetcher` abstracts this complexity behind a simple Python interface. Users can retrieve legal acts by publication date, date ranges, act type, publishing institution and textual content, while receiving Python objects or CSV outputs suitable for further analysis.

## Main features

- Search EU legal acts from the Official Journal of the European Union.
- Filter acts by date or date range, act type, publishing institution, text contained in the act title, language.
- Retrieve available act types and publishing institutions.
- Export act search results to CSV.
- Work with Python instead of raw SPARQL queries.
- Integrate easily with notebooks, data pipelines and legal analytics workflows.

## Use Cases

bulletin-fetcher can be used for:

- Legal analytics
- Public policy research
- Regulatory monitoring
- Reproducible studies based on legal acts
- Data collection pipelines

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install bulletin-fetcher
```

### Basic Usage Example

Fetch acts for a publication date:

```python
from bulletin.doue.api.client import DoueBulletinClient

client = DoueBulletinClient()
acts = client.get_acts( 
    date="2025-01-01",
    date_end="2025-03-31",
    title_contains="artificial intelligence",
    language="ENG"
)

print(f"Total acts: {len(acts)}")
if acts:
    first = acts[0]
    print(first.celex_uri)
    print(first.title)
```

### Example scripts

The repository includes runnable scripts with examples of use of the library:

```bash
python scripts/run_doue.py
```

And also a Jupyter Notebook: `scripts/run_doue.ipynb`.
